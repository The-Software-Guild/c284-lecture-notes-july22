// components & logic

//1
// wrapper component for both keypad and display meaning wrapper is parent to the K & D Siblings

//2 -> buttons 2.5
// keypad parent to 16 key components

// 3
// some way to recieve input from keys

// 4
// dispaly parent number input & number output which will be siblings of each other

// 5
// js calculator logic to perform operations on recieved key input

// 6. how do i do events in react and how do i display the result
// event on equal key to fire the operation side effect

// 8 this will be last 
// clearing mechanism to reset inputs

// 9
// review & refactor (removing any uneccsary coments, devlopment logs, refactoring,)

// styled compoent (air bnb)
// css => inline 


// if youa re trying to mount and render any conmponent it must be done from the parents 
// FILE NOT where the parent is rendered

// the idea that when react apps scale and your trees becaome really
// deep that you are forced into lifting state up to high 
// and passign it down through props to many levels
// prop drilling => antipattern
// anti pattern => decleration of a function within a components scope bounds
