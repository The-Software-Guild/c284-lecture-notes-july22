## Training Time (Class)

- Wednesday Aug 17th (4 weeks)

- Each week = a [sprint](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints) (**Sprint 1** will cover frontend technologies and intro to web development/software development practices [CI/CD, PM, html, JS, CSS, React], **Sprint 2** === React & SQL, **Sprint 3** === Java, **Sprint 4** hackathon.

- The **hackathon** is a group project that will culminate into a presentation infront of both LM and Wiley managers.

- **Intensity** = not everyone will finish every assignment and exercise. The goal is learning. We will talk, at length, on how to identify and deal with both knowledge gaps and time constraints.

- **Daily schedule** = training starts right at 8:30am EST with a standup. This brief meeting will serve as a way to ensure attendance and should individually cover the following: what have we worked on since we last saw each other, what do you plan to work on later, and what blockers (impediments) are you experiencing.

- Each day is segmented into **sessions**.

- **Breaks** occur after each session and last 5 - 15 minutes.

- **Lunch** will take placeusually after, or in the middle of, session 2. I will try to start this break around 11:30am - noon:30 and will last somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes.

- **End of day recap** will last between 5 and 10 minutes. It will consist of me talking and go over high level overview of concepts from the day or presentations from our last exercise. This will also be a time to set up the following days material or schedule.
